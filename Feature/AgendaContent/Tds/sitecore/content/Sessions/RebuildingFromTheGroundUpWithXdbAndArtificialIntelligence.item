As a leading law firm with over 700 lawyers, numerous practices and a global footprint, customer centricity is a top priority for Fasken.com. In order to become more client-centric, they needed to localize their global knowledge to offer a contextual and personalized experience. Doing so required a fundamental shift in web strategy, bringing control of their digital properties back in-house, and rebuilding their website from the ground up. During this session, attendees will learn about Faskenâs rebranding journey, the best practices that were applied and how adhering to them has turned their website into a high-quality lead generating platform and equipped their team to nurture stronger customer relationships.
