Forms are one of the most critical aspects of a website. They are the point of converting anonymous users to qualified leads, and eventually loyal customers. They are the beginning of a lifetime engagement. Yet, the average conversion rate on websites is 2.35%, with contact forms garnering less than 3% conversions.  In this session, we will give you a conversion boost by reviewing what the top 10% of websites are doing differently. With the help of Hexagon, we will share real-world implementations of similar experiences using Sitecore 9 forms and review their benefits with supportive analytics.  Expect to leave this session with a renewed vision for increasing leads and building lifelong customers on your website.
