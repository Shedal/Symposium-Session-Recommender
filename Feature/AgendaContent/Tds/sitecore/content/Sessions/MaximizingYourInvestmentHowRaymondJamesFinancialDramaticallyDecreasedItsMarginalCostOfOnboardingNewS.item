Raymond James Financial started their digital transformation almost three years ago with a dream of consolidating all their corporate and financial advisor sites onto a single platform (Sitecore). The goals of this journey were to design an ecosystem to support their 3,500+ sites, while increasing their marketing operations efficiency. That dream is now reality, as they can spin up new templated sites in as little as five minutes and create fully customized sites for their financial advisors at roughly 20% of the cost of previous hand-built sites.  In this session, weâll show how a shared component and content model makes it quick, easy, and cost effective to create fully customized and templated sites.
