Thule was established in Sweden in 1942 and is an international group of people united by a passion for helping active families and outdoor enthusiasts. With over 80 markets and 20 languages on Thule.com, using the Sitecore CMS has been instrumental in the companyâs global online presence for over a decade now. Together with Consid and Sitecore we developed a solution that was tightly integrated with our PIM, ERP, tax and payment providers.
