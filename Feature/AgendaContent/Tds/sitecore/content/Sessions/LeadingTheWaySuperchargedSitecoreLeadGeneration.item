We all know that Sitecore has powerful tools to drive your sales and marketing to higher thresholds. However, the jump from switching your website to Sitecore to generating instant results and proven ROI can be difficult to map. This session features perspectives from a Sitecore client and a Sitecore partner engaging in a website transformation to Sitecore. The vision of M/I Homes marketing has always been a strong focus on generating leads. Join us as we discuss the project and the end result, which is a set of highly configurable conversion forms, built specific to the clientâs needs which has led to a nearly 20% increase in lead generation.
